Tako is a distributed key-value data store. It aims to provide high scalability and availability through a shared nothing architecture, consistent hash based data partitioning, read repair with time stamping and live migration. An included coordinator server can be used as a single point of configuration to distribute cluster configuration to tako nodes in a cluster.

Tako includes a http proxy server that can be used to interface with a tako cluster using normal HTTP GET/POST.

Within a cluster, tako nodes communicate using a binary protocol and the socketless and syncless libraries.

Tako makes use of libev/libevent/kqueue/kpoll if present.
Tokyo Cabinet is used for data storage.
